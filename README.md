# PS_transformer_app
App to help with the process of testing transformers

All files placed in the repository should be placed inside the lib folder in your own flutter project.

This app includes a home page, a page for each part in the testing project, a summary page.
All values that are entered in the app are used to calculate the values on the summary page.

Right now the app can only be used to test one specific transformer, but eventualy I'd like to add a database to the app.
This would be used to store data of tested transformer and store data about transformer types.
